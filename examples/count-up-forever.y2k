# count-up-forever.y2k :: SKIP_TEST
# This program counts up by 1 in a loop indefinitely. It serves as an
# example of how you can instantiate variables through references to
# nonexistent variables. In this case, neither var 1 or var 2 exist before
# they're referenced, but are created (with a value of 0) in their respective
# commands.

611110 # while var 1 == 0
721011     # var 2 += 1
922        # print var 2
